===============================================================================

## 2. Project Description
This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:
- What your application does,
- Why you used the technologies you used,
- Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
